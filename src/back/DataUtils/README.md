# DataUtils

Use these scripts to format and upload data to the database. To start, you need a folder with multiple compressed (.gz) json files of the dataset.

1. Run Extract.py with the path of the compressed dataset.
2. Run Clean.py script to the path of the extracted data. 
3. Run Upload.py script to the path of the cleaned data.

You can use the same path and run all scripts in succession.
